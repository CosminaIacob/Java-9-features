<li> it helps you write simple code and test it in the cmd
<li> open cmd
<li> run jshell  command to enter the jshell

<li>J shell is not meant to create projects. The main intent is to get a prompt response when you want to check if the logic of the code or the output is correct or not.</li>
<li>we can edit the code that we have already executed with /edit command followed by the identifier of the line and an edit pad is opened</li>

<li>youâ€™re always in a complete loop: you first take an input and read it then you evaluate to see if it is correct, you print it and the loop keeps running around </li>

## 2. Collection Factory Methods

<li>Java 9 has added new static factory methods on list, set, and map interfaces</li>
<li>this makes it easier to create immutable instances of these collections</li>

<li> **Set** is an interface that extends the collection class and is an unordered collection of objects in which duplicate values cannot be stored</li>
<li> Create a set before and after Java 9: </li>

<li>List is a sub-interface of the collection class and it contains methods to insert or delete elements on an index basis</li>
